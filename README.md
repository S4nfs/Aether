## 🏁 A little about The project
 -  I was feeling somewhat bored and working on another project while I was looking for was the most effective yet cheapest fine-tuned LLM models that would support function calls for production. After trying all the models, i came up with the idea of ​​centrally testing the performance of these models in one place, so i started building Aether AI in two days. This project is still unfinished and has some bugs and unimplemented features. For example, chat history, clipboard, authentication features, etc. are missing. It will be available for free unless it exceeds the server costs or attacked by bots ;)

## 🐛 Updates & Known Bugs
- [x] Removed deprecated models and added newer ones like LLAMA 3.3 70B and Deepseek R1.
- [x] Dark mode support
- [ ] Text streaming is avoided as its keep failing to identify the code response in text, will get fixed in the next version.
- [x] Fixed: No formatting of chat responses.
- [x] Error Handling

## ✨ Bucket List:
- [ ] Use own models with API Keys
- [ ] Tool Calls
- [ ] File ingestion/embedding
- [ ] Support for image based LLMs
- [ ] Web Search 
- [ ] RAG

## 👨‍💻 License

Aether AI is open-source, licensed as GPL v3.

## 👋 Contribution
The code repo is currently private due to security issues, and I am also working on some other amazing projects and don't want to publish it as incomplete, as it is intended for regular use and not for production. Please provide feedback by raising an issue regarding how you are using Aether AI and what I can add or improve.
